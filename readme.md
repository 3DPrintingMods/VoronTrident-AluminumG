Because the belts are extended 3mm upwards and 3mm downwards (keeping the distance in between both belts as stock), the rear Z extrusion needs to be filed to allow clearance for the bottom belt, otherwise it will touch both extrusion and rear Z brackets. New Z brackets are available in the STL folder for 9mm belts.
