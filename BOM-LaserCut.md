## Where to get spacers and fancy washers
### Washers
Can be puchased on Amazon, Ebay or AliExpress. Search for "M3 Cup Washers".

### Spacers
M5 10mm spacers are easy to get on AliExpress, make sure they are not threaded. "Standoffs" are always threaded they are not what you want, spacers sometimes are called "washers".
M3 20mm spacers can be tricky to get. Not anodized version can be found on AliExpress. All anodized version I have found are threaded (standoffs) but can be easily drilled to remove threads.
